## Movie search app

This movie search app uses the Movie Database API to search for and show movies results. The page loads popular results by default. Users can search for their favorite film and see results. When you click on a movie, a modal brings up further information.

## To run this app

1. `git clone git@github.com:erintherad/movie_search.git` to initialize repo.
2. `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. `nodemon` || `node server.js` to run a simple server on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

## Information

This application was created in Javascript using jQuery in the front and Node/Express in the back. Twitter's [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) keep everything looking slick. I used Sass to compile all styles. Finally, I included a nifty rating library called [jQuery Bar Rating](http://antenna.io/demo/jquery-bar-rating/examples/) to showcase movie ratings.
